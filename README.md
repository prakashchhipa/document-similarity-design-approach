# document-similarity-design-approach (Non Coding Design Guideline By Utilizing ML/NLP capabilities)
Design approach(non-coding) to find out documents similarity for large corpus data around 15000 documents.

**Problem Statement:**

We have a set of 10,000-15,000 documents and we want to identify, Author, Method & Citation and want to find the relations among them. Describe the exact steps to do that. e.g. how pre-process, what do you need from manual annotation or data generally, what methods you use, what kind of ML task (s) this is and what are challenge and potential risks. Please detailed on what you would do.

**Design Solution:**
